The friction factor itself is dependent on internal pipe diameter, the 
internal pipe roughness and the Reynold's number which is in turn calculated from 
the fluid viscosity, fluid density, fluid velocity and the internal pipe diameter.

Fluid density


Fluid Viscosity

Fluid Viscosity, sometimes referred to as dynamic viscosity or absolute viscosity, 
is the fluid's resistance to flow, which is caused by a shearing stress within a flowing
fluid and between a flowing fluid and its container.
